# 🛣️ Road Accident Severity Prediction
The Road Accident Severity Prediction project aims to analyze and predict the severity of road accidents using machine learning techniques. The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information related to various factors such as weather conditions, road surface, light conditions, time, and location of accidents. By examining these attributes, the project seeks to identify the major factors contributing to severe accidents and develop a model capable of predicting the level of accident severity.

This project was implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Several libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn were used for data processing, visualization, and model development. The data preprocessing stage included cleaning missing values, handling duplicates, and encoding categorical variables to make the dataset suitable for machine learning algorithms. An extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to visualize patterns and relationships between different variables and accident severity levels.
